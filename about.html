So this is a site I built to visualize class data based on time of day (for the Fall 2017 semester)
 <br />  <br />
<b> How did I build this</b>
  <br />  <br />

I used Node.JS and puppeteer to go through my school’s course list and scrape data on when courses occurred, where they occurred, and how many people were registered. This is all stored in a JSON file. I visualize this data using Heatmap.js with the gmaps plugin. I use chart.js for all the charts.
 <br />  <br />

 
<b>Why did I build this?</b>
 <br />  <br />
Parking at my school sucks. The problems is that it is difficult to get a spot that is good, or sometimes even one that just isn't terrible. The vox populi says the university needs to build more parking to solve this. I don't think this is the issue (although it can't hurt), I think there is just some poor campus resource utilization where some parts of campus are overutilized at certain times while others are not utilized enough. 
 <br />  <br />
<b>The questions I had</b>
 <br />  <br />
I had two theories on how to improve parking without building more parking spots. The first is that classes were too condensed in terms of time. This can be visualized by chart A. The second, is that classes were too condensed in terms of location. This can be visualized by the map and chart C. 
 <br />  <br />
<b>Theory 1: Time</b>
 <br />  <br />
Looking at Chart A, there are certain obvious cases where far too many students, or far too few students, are in classes. One case is on Tuesday at 10:05 AM. The amount of students peaks at 1.3 standard deviations above the mean, which indicates to me that this time slot is over utilized. Another case is 12PM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Here the number of students is 1.35 standard deviations below the mean, which indicates to me that this time slot is underutilized. Aside from this, the time slots of 4PM-6PM are generally close to the mean. They could possibly be utilized slightly more. The only other times that are severely underutilized are either super early or late in the day, and I doubt any college student would be okay with more classes at those times.
 <br />  <br />
One extremely important thing to note is that on every day, there are 10 minutes spots throughout the day where class populations drop by 3000 on more. This is because they schedule a large number of classes to start and end at the same time. On MWF, the classes are 1 hour, and these times are 9:40-10:40, 10:50-11:50, etc. On Tuesday and Thursday, the classes are 1 hour and 25 minutes, and the slots go 8:30-9:55, 10:05-11:30, etc. The point is, on every day It’s a 10 minute break where a massive amount of people are moving to and from classes. I think this is a major issue for two reasons. The first issue is that it causes a lot of car traffic getting on and off campus because everyone is doing it at the same time. The second and more major issues is that 10 minutes isn’t enough time for people to leave class and get to their cars before others arrive. The result of this is that students are arriving for the next major class time before people from the last major class time have left. While everyone will get a spot eventually here, it raises the perception that parking is worse than it is, because people have longer waits for spots, and people will often be late to class by the time they get a spot. 
 <br />  <br />
This point is the only idea I’ve been able to anecdotally prove. My guess was people need 5 minutes to get to their car after class, I figured that if instead of showing up 10 minutes early, I show up 5 minutes early, I’ll often get to class earlier because I’ll get a better spot. This did end up working out! I found 5 minutes is the perfect timing for when the spots will start opening, so if I get to a good lot 5 minutes before class (or if I get there 10 minutes before), I’ll catch people as they leave their spots. I’ve had friends who didn’t use this advice, show up 10 minutes early, find no good spots, and take a spot that is so bad that their walk to class is longer than the 5 minutes extra I waited to park and so I beat them to class. I’ve had success with this basically every single day. This trick isn’t a solution for parking as a whole though, because if everyone starts using this it will cease to work, but I’m happy to keep taking advantage of it.
 <br />  <br />
The real solution to this problem Is to not have these major class times. If people were constantly arriving and leaving, instead of arriving and leaving all at once, it’d alleviate car traffic and not require people to show up immediately before class to have a chance at getting a decent spot. Another solution would be to have 15 minutes between classes so that there is a bit more time for people to leave and get there so there isn’t as many people leaving while people are arriving. Unfortunately neither of these are great solutions. No major class complicate class scheduling a lot. Adding 5 minutes between classes would add an extra half hour onto most days, which may not be a huge deal but is still a problem.
 <br />  <br />
<b>Theory 2: Space</b>
 <br />  <br />
This one is a little more difficult to quantify. Looking at the heat map, we can see that most classes occur on the east side of campus. This is because there are very few large buildings capable of holding classes on the west side. If the large buildings were more distributed across campus, with some lots being placed on the west side as well, there may be a small improvement in parking.
 <br />  <br />
<b>Other random plots and observations</b>
 <br />  <br />
While I had all this data, I looked at various other trends and figures I thought may be interesting. One such case was the average size of each class. On most days, this had a noticeable decrease as the day went on, probably due to less lectures later in the day. However, it also had a large jump very late in the day on most days, not sure what was causing that. Finally, Friday didn't follow any of those trends.
 <br />  <br />
Following this trend, the only time the lecture hall isn't the most occupied is early in the day and late in the day.
 <br />  <br />
The max amount of students in class was 6372 on Tuesday at 10:15. The day with the lowest max amount of students was Friday with 5027 students. Not very surprising, people avoid Friday classes.
 <br />  <br />
I have no clue why 12PM on MWF is so lightly used, when this doesn't occur on Tuesday Thursday. Seems strange that a lunch break is only given 3 times a week?
 <br />  <br />
<b>Some notes on parking</b>
I don't visualize this, but using some GIS data that a friend provided me, I calculated that there are 5733 spots on campus for commuters to park in for free. Of these, around 1000 can be expected to be occupied by residents with parking permits who aren't moving their cars to go to class. This leaves 4733 spots available for commuters. I had data on parking throughout the day, but the data only covers 4 time slots a day, which I wasn't sure what to do with. If it was more comprehensive I would have loved to plot it side by side with classes. Also, I honestly think their methodology was flawed. They took data at 8AM, 12PM, 3PM, and 7PM. I don't think any of those times are necessarily the most interesting times to see the parking. Its no surprise that there is plenty of parking at 8AM and 7PM, and 12PM and 3PM aren't the peak times on any day so the data here won't show the worst of the issue.
 <br />  <br />
<b>Conclusions</b>
 <br />  <br />
Based on this data, I think it was fair to say that campus utilization isn’t perfect, but it also isn’t as bad as I expected. 
 <br />  <br />
Class populations did generally fall close to the mean, although there are a few cases for improvement. The most major improvement that could be made here would be extending the day so that more classes occurred at 6 and later, but this is a non-ideal solution for students who don’t want to stay late, and for the school that would have to keep extra staff around later. The other solution was to stop having major class times, or to add a bit more time between classes if major class times exist.
 <br />  <br />
As for class locations, it does seem problematic to me, but also not a viable solution. It’s not like the school can just pick up one of the major buildings and move it to the west side of campus. If the campus had been planned to be a little more future proof this could have helped, but the buildings on the west side have been there since the 60s or earlier (and used to be dorms) so it’s hard to blame them.
 <br />  <br />
This is all my personal take on the data, I’d love to hear what other people’s conclusions to this problem are.
